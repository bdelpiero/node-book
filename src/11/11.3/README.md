I copied this code from [this dude's solution](https://github.com/kasymbayaman/node.js-design-patterns-solutions/tree/main/11-advanced-recipes/11.3-deep-async-cancelable)

I added notes to try to figure out how the f* (not a generator btw) does any of this work.

See [this mdn article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/yield*) for a reference on how delegated generators work and the diagrams on this repo for an attempt on a visual explanation on my behalf.
